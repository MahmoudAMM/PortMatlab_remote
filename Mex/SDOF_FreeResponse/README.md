This directory includes Visual Studio Fortran and C++ projects that create Matlab Mex files (shared libraries, i.e.: dll's for Windows). These projects show how you can write code similar to Matlab code but using C++ and Fortran.
Projects in this directory use:
1) header files within the Mex directory
2) Intel MKL

Till now, projects in this directory are tested on MS Visual Studio 2017, Matlab 2017b and Intel Parallel Studio XE 2017.

Projects under this directory calculate the free response of a SDOF system. Details behind these methods are explained in the graduate course AER 631: Dynamics of Structures.

Projects in this directory:
	1) C_MEX
	2) Cpp_MEX
	3) Fortran_MEX
